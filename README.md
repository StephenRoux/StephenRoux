Hi I'm SteveðŸ™‚

I am an IT graduate with 5 years tertiary education and I have a passion for Tech.
I think Web Development is cool and that's where I focus my time, 
but I also think Blockchain Technology is awesome and a total gamechanger (Till quantum computing advances..yikes!)

I'm new to GIT and still learning the ropes but if you want to link up, shoot through an email. ðŸ“§stephenroux.roux@gmail.com
